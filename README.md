# Chat-Game
A basic game/Lobby system built on top of a solid chat system.
------
1. This is my first attempt at windows forms, threading and server-client connections.
2. It Does not use Async Tasks as this was a requirement.
3. The game and lobby system are built ontop of the chat which works but if done again would not of been done.
